## üìå About This Repository  
This repository contains problem sets from **POLI 271**, a graduate-level course on **statistical modeling and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)**. These problem sets were developed by **Professor John Ahlquist** to provide hands-on experience in applying **MLE, logistic and probit regression, model evaluation, and cross-validation** to real-world political science data.  

Through these exercises, I have implemented **likelihood-based inference**, explored **distributional assumptions**, and evaluated the **predictive performance** of various models using **simulation, visualization, and statistical diagnostics**.  

### üîç **Key Topics Covered**
- Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
- Binary Outcome Modeling & Model Evaluation
- Logistic vs. Probit Regression**: Predicting civil war onset using the Fearon & Laitin dataset  
- Cross-Validation
- Evaluating classification models
